# Project Title:
HORISEON

# Project Description:

-In this Project, a marketing agency has hired me to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible.I have worked on starter code that was modified. 
-This project involved a very important aspect of web development which is "accessibility". Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. 
-It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards.

# Project Aim:

-To impress clients by improving the codebase for long-term sustainability.
-Make the code Cleaner to make it more readable to coders and accessible to users by following Scout Rule.
-Create a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that the site is optimized for search engines.


# Project Requirements/ Acceptance Criteria:

In order for the webpage to meet accessibility standards:
-When a user view the source code, they should find semantic HTML elements.
-When a user the structure of the HTML elements, they should find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
-When a user view the image elements, they find accessible alt attributes.
-When a user view the heading attributes then they fall in sequential order.
-When a user view the title element then they  find a concise, descriptive title.
-Ensure that all links are functioning correctly and clean up the CSS to make it more efficient, such as by consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.

# Refracting Codes:
1. HTML file:   
    -Add semnatic elements
    - Remove the <div> elements and replace with 'section'
    -Add main, article, aside, nav elements to make it more organized.
    -Sequencially arrange heading attributes.
    -Add 'alt' attributes to the 'img src' making it more  accessible.
    -Add relative path urls to the images.
    -Making the file organized by adding 'header' and 'footer' elements to the body.
    -Make sure all urls are working without errors.

2. CSS file:
    -Add concise and descriptive titles for required elements.
    -Make changes to the css properties according to html elements, class and id used.
    -Remove and replace uneccessary selectors making the file more readable, easy and clean for other code readers.
3. Create a License file.
4. Create a Readme.md file.
5. Create .gitignore file for untracked files.

6. Git Repository:
    -This repository has a unique name.
    -This repository follows best practices for file structure and naming conventions.
    -This repository follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.
    -This repository contains multiple descriptive commit messages.
    -This repository contains quality README file with description and link to deployed application.
    -Clone the repository usinG git clone <link>
    -Use git add . after adding, deleting, changing files.
    -Use git commit -m "message" to commit the added files to repository.
    -Use git push origin main for pushing the commited files to main branch.


# Outcomes of project:

Making a website accessible is also good for business for many reasons, one of them being that accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google and to avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities can't access their website.
